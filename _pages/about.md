# Choose Natural Materials

You want to gather natural materials so you can tap into the Earth's energies. Ideally, the water you use should not be filtered or chlorinated. Spring water is always a good choice if you don't have access to water from a rainstorm, stream, or other naturally flowing water.

Supplies you need:

- Scrying bowl (ceramic or glass)
- Water (spring, stream, or rain)
- White candle
- Candle (select color for reading)
- 2 candle holders
- Matches
- Paper
- Pencil

## Step One: Choose Your Candle Color
You want to select a candle color that best matches your intentions. For example, if you are scrying for a financial or money issue, then select either a green or gold candle.

## Step Two: Cleanse Space
You will use either sage or another favorite incense to clear the space you intend to use while scrying. If you have a ritual you practice for space clearing, you can use it. You can either sit at a table, altar or on the floor, according to what is most comfortable for you.

## Step Three: Light White Candle
You will need to set the white candle in its holder and light it as part of your cleansing ritual. You can recite a prayer, blessing, or chant if you wish.

## Step Four: Open a Protective Circle and Meditate
You should open a protective circle the same as you would for any spellwork. You will then assume a comfortable position and spend a few minutes in meditation to clear your thoughts and energy field.

## Step Five: Fill Scrying Bowl
You will pour the natural water you intend to use into your scrying bowl. You can say a prayer or chant to bless the water.

## Step Six: Form Your Question of Inquiry
You will use the paper and pencil to form your question. Give this some thought before writing, since changing what you've written can confuse the response. You want to be very clear and precise in forming your question.

## Step Seven: Light Scrying Candle
You will light the candle you selected for scrying. Repeat your question and hold it in your mind while holding the candle over the water. You'll let the wax drip into the water. Don't touch the bowl while you drip wax into the water. Once you are satisfied that you've let enough wax fall into the water, you can extinguish the candle and set it down.

## Step Eight: Scry the Candle Wax
Take a deep breath and focus on the wax in the scrying bowl. You will note any shapes the drippings form. You can write them down on the paper, using the pencil, if you wish. You should write down any psychic or intuitive impressions or messages you receive.

## Step Nine: Interpreting Candle Wax Meanings
Interpreting the wax drippings may take some time. You should first and foremost trust your intuition. A few tips include:

Shapes can have literal meanings, such as circle represents the closing of a circle, or a triangle may indicate a love triangle or opposition.
Numbers may be related to the calendar and represent days, weeks, months, and so on.
Numbers may represent a specific time such as hours, minutes, or seconds.
Number may be a combination of a date and time.
Letters can represent the initials of a person, place, or event.
Animal shapes can be literal or represent an animal spirit guide.
Step Ten: Wax Scrying Reading and Conclusions
While number, shapes, and letters are cool, mostly likely you'll end up with various abstract forms floating on the water. This is why your intuition and psychic abilities are so important when interpreting the message of your candle wax scrying. You should always trust your psychic impressions over all things.

## Step Eleven: Close Protection Circle
You want to close your circle when you are finished with your scrying. You will then extinguish the white candle.
